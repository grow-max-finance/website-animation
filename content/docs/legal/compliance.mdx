# Compliance & Legal

This section outlines the legal positioning, compliance approach, and risk framework governing the Growmax platform.

Growmax is designed as a technology-enabled digital asset participation platform, not as a traditional financial institution. Products are governed strictly by documented terms and automated rules.

Users are responsible for understanding how Growmax applies within their local legal and regulatory environment.

## Regulatory Positioning

Growmax:

- Is not a bank, broker, or deposit-taking institution
- Does not offer guaranteed or discretionary returns
- Does not provide investment advice or portfolio management
- Does not act as a fiduciary on behalf of users

Participation in Growmax products is voluntary and user-initiated, executed through wallet-based interaction.

## Jurisdictional Scope

Growmax operates as a global digital platform.

Due to differences in laws across jurisdictions:

- Products may not be suitable for all users
- Certain jurisdictions may impose restrictions on digital asset usage
- Users are responsible for compliance with local laws

Growmax does not actively solicit participation in restricted jurisdictions.

## User Responsibility

By using Growmax, users acknowledge that they are responsible for:

- Understanding applicable laws and regulations
- Assessing product suitability
- Declaring and reporting digital asset activity where required

Growmax does not provide tax, legal, or regulatory advice.

## No Guarantees or Protections

Growmax does not provide:

- Capital protection
- Deposit insurance
- Government-backed guarantees

All participation involves risk, including potential loss of capital.
