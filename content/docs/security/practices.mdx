# Security Practices

Growmax security is enforced through structural constraints, not manual intervention.

The platform is designed so that even if systems are compromised, asset loss vectors are limited by design.

## Wallet-Based Security Model

- No accounts or credentials
- No password resets
- No email-based access

User identity and authority are derived entirely from wallet signatures.

## Fixed Withdrawal Address Enforcement

Growmax enforces a non-changeable withdrawal address policy.

- Assets can be withdrawn only to the wallet used for deposit
- Withdrawal destinations cannot be changed
- No whitelisting or alternate addresses are supported

This prevents:

- Withdrawal redirection attacks
- Insider manipulation
- Social-engineering-based fund theft

## Product-Level Controls

Security is enforced at the product level:

- Earn assets are locked by participation rules
- Borrow collateral is locked until loan resolution
- LTV thresholds and liquidation are automated

No operator can manually override these controls.

## Automated Enforcement

Growmax relies on predefined rules for:

- Reward accrual
- Borrow monitoring
- Margin call detection
- Liquidation execution

All enforcement is automatic and uniform.

## Internal Access Controls

Operational access is restricted through:

- Role-based permissions
- Segregation of duties
- Logged and monitored activity

No single operator has unilateral control over user assets.

## Infrastructure Monitoring

Growmax maintains monitoring for:

- Transaction processing
- System availability
- Anomalous behaviour

Security incidents are handled via predefined response procedures.

## User Responsibility

Users are responsible for:

- Securing their wallet and private keys
- Using trusted devices and networks
- Verifying transactions before approval

Growmax cannot recover assets lost due to wallet compromise.

## Security Limitations

No digital system is risk-free.

Growmax does not guarantee:

- Immunity from cyber threats
- Recovery from all failure scenarios

Security practices reduce risk but do not eliminate it.
