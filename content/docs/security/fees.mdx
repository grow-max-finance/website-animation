# Fees & Charges

This section explains the fees applicable when using Growmax products.

Growmax follows a transparent, minimal-fee structure. All applicable fees are defined in advance and enforced automatically. There are no hidden charges, discretionary adjustments, or retroactive changes.

## General Fee Principles

Growmax applies the following principles to all fees:

- Fees are clearly disclosed before participation
- Fees are product-specific and rule-based
- No hidden or undocumented charges apply
- Fee logic does not change during active participation

Users are encouraged to review fee terms before committing assets.

## Earn Products – Fees

### Participation Fees

- **No participation fees** apply to Growmax Earn products
- Users can enter Flexible Earn or Fixed Earn without paying any upfront platform fee

### Withdrawal Fees

- **0% withdrawal fee** applies to all Earn withdrawals
- Growmax does not charge any platform-level fee for withdrawing Earn assets or rewards
- Users are responsible only for applicable BNB Chain network (gas) fees

### Early Exit Fees (Fixed Earn Only)

Fixed Earn includes predefined early exit conditions:

- **90-day notice exit:** No capital deduction
- **Instant exit:** 6% capital deduction

These deductions are product rules, not discretionary fees, and apply only when early exit is selected.

## Borrow Products – Fees

Borrow products may involve the following charges:

### Borrow Interest

- Interest is applied to borrowed amounts
- Rates are disclosed before loan confirmation
- Interest accrues according to product terms
- Interest rates are fixed at loan initiation and enforced automatically

In the event of liquidation:

- Execution costs and market slippage may apply
- These costs depend on market conditions at the time of liquidation
- Growmax does not impose discretionary liquidation penalties

### Repayment Fees

- No additional platform fees apply for loan repayment
- Network (gas) fees are borne by the user

## Referral Program – Fees

- No fees are charged on referral rewards
- Referral rewards do not reduce the referred user's earnings
- Referral rewards are calculated and settled independently of fees

## Network Fees

Growmax does not control blockchain network fees.

Users may incur:

- BNB Chain gas fees for deposits and withdrawals
- Transaction fees imposed by the blockchain network

These fees are paid directly to the network, not to Growmax.

## Fee Visibility

All applicable fees and deductions are:

- Displayed before transaction confirmation
- Reflected transparently in the platform interface
- Applied consistently across all users

There are no conditional or undisclosed charges.

## No Hidden Charges

Growmax does not charge for:

- Account creation

**If a fee is not documented, it does not apply.**
