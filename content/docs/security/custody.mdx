# Custody Model

Growmax applies a controlled, product-based custody model designed to support structured products without over-exposing user assets.

Custody exists only when required and only for the duration of active participation.

## Wallet-Initiated Custody

- Users deposit assets directly from their own wallet
- Custody begins only after user confirmation
- Growmax does not create or manage user wallets
- Private keys and seed phrases are never accessed or stored

## Product-Scoped Custody

Custody is applied per product, not per user.

- Earn assets are custodied only for Earn execution
- Borrow collateral is custodied only to secure loans
- Assets are not reused or repurposed

Custody ends immediately upon withdrawal or product completion.

## Ownership & Use Restrictions

- Legal ownership of assets remains with the user
- Assets are not rehypothecated
- Assets are not used outside documented product purposes
- There is no discretionary use of user assets

## Asset Release

Custody ends when:

- An Earn withdrawal is executed
- A Fixed Earn product reaches maturity
- A Borrow loan is repaid
- A liquidation event completes

Assets are returned to the originating wallet only.

## Custody Limitations

Growmax custody does not imply:

- Deposit insurance
- Capital guarantees
- Banking or trust services

Custody exists solely to enable product functionality.
