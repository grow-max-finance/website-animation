# Platform Architecture

Growmax is built as a wallet-connected, product-driven platform operating exclusively on BNB Chain.

The architecture separates user interaction, product logic, and asset handling to ensure predictable execution and risk containment.

## Wallet-Connected Interaction Layer

Growmax operates without traditional user accounts.

- No usernames, emails, or passwords
- No internal user wallets
- Access is established via wallet connection only

All actions — deposits, withdrawals, borrowing — require explicit wallet approval.

This removes common attack vectors such as credential theft and account takeovers.

## Product-Driven Logic

Each Growmax product (Earn, Borrow, Referral) operates within a defined logic layer that governs:

- Asset eligibility
- Network enforcement
- Reward calculation
- Exit and withdrawal conditions
- Risk thresholds

Product rules are fixed at participation and enforced automatically.

## Single-Chain Execution

Growmax operates exclusively on BNB Chain.

This design choice:

- Eliminates cross-chain bridge risk
- Ensures consistent pricing and monitoring
- Enables faster and more reliable liquidation execution

All deposits, withdrawals, and collateral interactions occur on BNB Chain only.

## Asset Segregation

Assets are segregated by product:

- Earn assets are isolated from Borrow collateral
- Borrow collateral is isolated by asset type
- Referral rewards are accounted for separately

There is no cross-product commingling of assets.

## On-Chain & Off-Chain Coordination

Growmax uses a hybrid approach:

- **On-chain:** asset transfers, confirmations, settlement
- **Off-chain:** product accounting, reward calculation, monitoring

This allows scalable operations while maintaining transparent execution.
