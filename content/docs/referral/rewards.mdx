# How Referral Rewards Work

This section explains how referral rewards are calculated, accrued, tracked, and settled on Growmax.

Referral rewards on Growmax are mechanical and rule-based. They are not discretionary, estimated, or promotional. Rewards are generated only when real Earn activity occurs and are calculated using predefined logic.

## Core Principle

Referral rewards are directly linked to actual Earn rewards generated by referred users.

If a referred user does not earn rewards, no referral reward is created.

There are no signup bonuses, volume bonuses, or speculative incentives.

## Reward Calculation Logic

Referral rewards are calculated as a fixed percentage of the referred user's Earn rewards.

- **Referral Reward Rate:** 10%
- **Reward Base:** Daily Earn rewards of the referred user
- **Calculation Frequency:** Daily

### Formula

```
Referral Reward = Referred User's Daily Earn Reward × 10%
```

**Example:**
- Referred user earns 10 USDT in a day
- Referrer earns 1 USDT as referral reward

This calculation is repeated daily for as long as eligibility conditions are met.

## Daily Accrual

Referral rewards:

- Accrue daily
- Are calculated alongside Earn rewards
- Reflect real product performance, not projections

There is no manual approval or batching process involved in reward generation.

## Reward Visibility

Referral rewards are:

- Displayed separately from Earn rewards
- Visible through the platform interface
- Updated on a daily basis

This separation ensures transparency between personal Earn activity and referral-derived rewards.

## Reward Settlement

Referral rewards follow the same settlement principles as Earn rewards:

- Rewards accrue while eligibility conditions are met
- Rewards settle upon withdrawal or according to product rules
- Rewards are not automatically compounded unless explicitly stated

Settlement rules are enforced uniformly.

## Eligibility Dependency

Referral rewards accrue only when all eligibility conditions are met, including:

- The referred user has an active Earn product
- The referrer maintains an active Earn product

If either condition is not met:

- Referral rewards stop accruing
- Accrual resumes automatically when eligibility is restored
- No retroactive rewards are applied

## Lifetime Alignment

Referral rewards are lifetime-aligned, not time-bound.

This means:

- Rewards continue as long as the referred user earns
- There is no fixed expiry or cap
- Rewards stop naturally if Earn participation stops

This design discourages short-term promotion and encourages quality referrals.

## Self-Referral Treatment

Self-referrals are treated identically to standard referrals.

- All eligibility rules apply
- Rewards are calculated the same way
- No preferential treatment exists

There are no artificial restrictions or exclusions.

## No Manual Adjustments

Growmax does not:

- Manually modify referral rewards
- Backdate or estimate rewards
- Grant discretionary bonuses

All rewards are generated and enforced automatically.

## Important Considerations

Users should note that:

- Referral rewards are dependent on Earn participation
- Market or operational factors affecting Earn rewards will also affect referral rewards
- Referral rewards do not reduce referred users' earnings

Growmax encourages responsible referral activity based on understanding, not promotion.

## Summary

Referral rewards on Growmax are:

- Single-level
- Performance-linked
- Daily accrued
- Transparent and rule-based

This ensures fairness, predictability, and alignment with real platform usage.
