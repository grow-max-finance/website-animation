# Referral Program Overview

The Growmax Referral Program is a simple, single-level reward system designed to align long-term platform usage with user-driven growth.

The program rewards users for introducing others to Growmax only when real product participation occurs. Referral rewards are directly linked to actual Earn activity and are governed by clear, enforceable rules.

Growmax deliberately avoids complex, multi-level, or incentive-driven referral structures. The objective is to encourage genuine usage, not speculative promotion.

## Purpose of the Referral Program

The Growmax Referral Program is designed to:

- Incentivise users to introduce Growmax to others responsibly
- Align referral rewards with real product participation
- Avoid speculative or promotional abuse
- Maintain a clean, transparent reward structure

Referral rewards exist to recognise contribution to platform growth, not to replace product usage.

## Single-Level Structure

Growmax operates a single-level referral model only.

This means:

- You earn rewards only from users you directly refer
- There are no second-level or downstream commissions
- There are no hierarchical or network-based reward chains

This structure ensures clarity, fairness, and simplicity.

## Referral Reward Model

Referral rewards are calculated as a percentage of the actual rewards earned by the referred user.

- **Referral Reward Rate:** 10%
- Rewards are based solely on the referred user's Earn rewards
- Referral rewards do not reduce the referred user's earnings

If the referred user does not earn, no referral reward is generated.

## Lifetime Reward Alignment

Referral rewards are designed to be long-term aligned.

- Rewards accrue for the lifetime of the referral relationship
- Rewards continue as long as the referred user remains actively earning
- There is no cap, expiry, or fixed duration

This model incentivises quality referrals rather than volume.

## Active Participation Requirement

To earn referral rewards, the referrer must maintain an active Growmax Earn product.

This ensures:

- Referrers have direct exposure to the platform
- Rewards are earned by users with active participation
- The program remains aligned with real usage

If the referrer does not have an active Earn allocation, referral rewards do not accrue during that period.

## Reward Accrual & Payout

Referral rewards:

- Accrue daily
- Are calculated alongside Earn rewards
- Are visible through the platform interface
- Follow the same settlement logic as Earn rewards

Referral rewards are not compounded unless explicitly stated.

## Self-Referral Policy

Growmax permits self-referrals.

Self-referrals are treated the same as any other referral and are subject to all standard eligibility rules, including the requirement to maintain an active Earn product.

There are no special cases or exclusions.

## No Promotional Guarantees

The Referral Program does not guarantee:

- Earnings from referrals
- Fixed referral income
- Success from promotion

Referral rewards depend entirely on the referred user's actual Earn participation.

## Transparency & Enforcement

All referral rules are:

- Documented clearly
- Enforced automatically
- Applied uniformly to all users

There are no discretionary exceptions or manual adjustments.

## Positioning Summary

The Growmax Referral Program is positioned as:

- A participation-aligned reward system
- Single-level and transparent
- Linked directly to real product usage
- Free from complex incentive mechanisms
