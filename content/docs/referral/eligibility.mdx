# Eligibility & Rules

This section defines the eligibility conditions, boundaries, and enforcement rules governing participation in the Growmax Referral Program.

Referral rewards on Growmax are governed strictly by predefined rules. These rules apply uniformly to all users and are enforced automatically. There are no discretionary exceptions, manual approvals, or special cases.

## Eligibility to Earn Referral Rewards

To earn referral rewards on Growmax, all of the following conditions must be met:

- The referrer must have an active Growmax Earn product
- The referred user must have an active Growmax Earn product
- Rewards must be generated through actual Earn participation

If any of these conditions are not met, referral rewards do not accrue.

## Active Earn Requirement

Referral rewards are conditional on active Earn participation by the referrer.

- Referral rewards accrue only while the referrer maintains an active Earn allocation
- If the referrer exits all Earn products, referral rewards stop accruing
- Accrual resumes automatically when the referrer re-enters an Earn product
- Referral rewards are not retroactive for periods without active Earn participation

## Referred User Activity Requirement

Referral rewards are generated only when the referred user:

- Has an active Earn product
- Is accruing Earn rewards

If the referred user:

- Withdraws from Earn, or
- Does not generate Earn rewards

No referral rewards are created for that period.

## Single-Level Enforcement

The Growmax Referral Program operates on a single-level basis only.

This means:

- Rewards are earned only from users you directly refer
- No rewards are generated from referrals of referrals
- No network, tree, or hierarchy structures exist
- Multi-level or cascading rewards are not supported

## Self-Referral Policy

Growmax permits self-referrals.

Self-referrals:

- Are treated the same as standard referrals
- Must meet all eligibility conditions
- Require an active Earn product to generate rewards

There are no additional restrictions or benefits associated with self-referrals.

## Reward Integrity & Abuse Prevention

Growmax enforces referral rules programmatically to ensure integrity.

The platform does not permit:

- Manual manipulation of referral rewards
- Artificial reward generation without Earn activity
- Discretionary reward adjustments

All rewards are calculated strictly based on real product participation.

## Suspension or Restriction

Growmax reserves the right to restrict referral participation if:

- Platform rules are intentionally abused
- Activity violates applicable laws or Terms of Use
- Actions compromise platform integrity

Any restriction is applied according to documented enforcement procedures.

## No Guarantees

Referral participation does not guarantee:

- Referral income
- Minimum rewards
- Continued eligibility

Rewards depend entirely on actual Earn activity and compliance with rules.

## Transparency & Enforcement

All eligibility rules:

- Are documented publicly
- Are enforced automatically
- Apply equally to all users

There are no hidden conditions or unpublished requirements.

## User Responsibility

Users are responsible for:

- Understanding eligibility conditions
- Maintaining active Earn participation
- Monitoring referral activity through the platform

Growmax does not provide reminders or warnings regarding eligibility status.

## Summary

Referral eligibility on Growmax is governed by:

- Active Earn participation
- Single-level structure
- Real reward generation
- Automated enforcement

This framework ensures fairness, predictability, and alignment with genuine platform usage.
