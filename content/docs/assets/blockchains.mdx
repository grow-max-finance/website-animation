# Supported Blockchains

This section defines the blockchain, token standards, and asset rules that govern all activity on Growmax.

Growmax operates on a single blockchain and a single token standard to ensure maximum clarity, security, and operational reliability.

**There is no multi-chain support on Growmax.**

## Supported Blockchain

Growmax operates exclusively on **BNB Chain**.

- All products run on BNB Chain
- All deposits and withdrawals must be made on BNB Chain
- Cross-chain activity is not supported

This single-chain design eliminates bridge risk, pricing inconsistency, and cross-network execution complexity.

## Supported Token Standard

Growmax supports **BEP-20 tokens only**.

- ERC-20 tokens are not supported
- TRC-20 tokens are not supported
- Tokens on any other standard are not supported

Users must ensure assets conform strictly to the BEP-20 standard.

## Unsupported Assets & Networks

Growmax does not support:

- Ethereum mainnet
- Tron
- Any other blockchain
- ERC-20 or TRC-20 tokens
- NFTs, LP tokens, or experimental assets

**Assets sent on unsupported networks or standards may be permanently unrecoverable.**
