# Supported Tokens

Growmax supports a limited, product-specific set of assets.

This restriction is intentional and central to the platform's risk framework.

## Earn – Supported Token

Growmax Earn supports **USDT (BEP-20) only**.

- Both Flexible Earn and Fixed Earn accept USDT on BNB Chain
- No other stablecoins or assets are accepted for Earn

Using a single stable asset ensures predictable reward calculation and simplified accounting.

## Borrow – Supported Collateral Tokens (BEP-20 Only)

Growmax Borrow accepts the following assets only in BEP-20 form:

- **BTC (BEP-20)**
- **ETH (BEP-20)**
- **SOL (BEP-20)**
- **BNB (native / BEP-20)**

No other assets, wrapped variants, or synthetic tokens are accepted as collateral.

## Asset Restrictions

All supported assets must:

- Be on BNB Chain
- Conform to BEP-20 standard
- Be explicitly listed as supported

Using unsupported assets may result in permanent loss.
