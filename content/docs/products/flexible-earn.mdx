# Flexible Earn (12%)

Flexible Earn is designed for users who prioritise liquidity and flexibility while earning a predictable return on their digital assets.

This product allows participants to earn a fixed annual return without committing to a long-term lock-in, making it suitable for users who may need access to capital while still generating yield.

## Product Objective

The objective of Flexible Earn is to provide:

- Daily, predictable returns
- No fixed lock-in period
- Transparent and simple participation
- Easy entry and exit

Flexible Earn is intentionally conservative in structure and avoids complex mechanics or conditional rules.

## Supported Asset

**Asset:** USDT

Flexible Earn supports USDT only. This ensures stability in reward calculations and avoids exposure to price volatility commonly associated with other digital assets.

## Return Structure

- **Return Rate:** 12% per annum
- **Reward Accrual:** Daily

Returns are calculated on the basis of active participation and accrue daily. The stated return rate does not fluctuate based on market conditions.

There are no performance-linked bonuses or variable yield components.

## Participation Mechanics

Participation in Flexible Earn is fully user-initiated:

1. The user connects a supported wallet
2. The user deposits USDT into the Flexible Earn product
3. Rewards begin accruing from the next accrual cycle

All deposits require explicit wallet approval.
