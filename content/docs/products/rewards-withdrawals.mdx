# Rewards & Withdrawals

This section explains how rewards are calculated, accrued, displayed, and withdrawn across Growmax Earn products, as well as the rules governing withdrawal execution and asset release.

Growmax is designed to provide predictable reward behaviour and controlled withdrawals, eliminating ambiguity around earnings visibility and fund access.

## Reward Accrual Framework

All Growmax Earn products follow a daily reward accrual model.

Key characteristics:

- Rewards accrue on a daily basis
- Accrual is calculated based on the active principal
- Accrual begins after successful product participation
- Accrual ends when assets are withdrawn or the product lifecycle completes

Rewards are calculated according to the specific product terms selected at participation.

## Fixed-Rate Reward Calculation

Growmax Earn products use a fixed-rate structure.

This means:

- Reward rates are defined upfront
- Rates do not fluctuate based on market conditions
- There are no variable APYs or performance-based adjustments
- Reward calculations are not influenced by platform discretion

This fixed structure allows users to understand expected outcomes before committing capital.

## Daily Accounting & Visibility

Rewards are accounted for and displayed daily.

Users can:

- View accrued rewards through the platform interface
- Monitor earnings throughout the participation period
- Track rewards separately from principal

Daily visibility ensures transparency and reduces uncertainty around earnings.

## Reward Settlement

Rewards are settled according to product rules:

- Rewards accumulate during active participation
- Rewards are settled upon withdrawal or product completion
- Rewards are not automatically compounded unless explicitly stated

Any compounding behaviour, if introduced, would be documented clearly and require user action.

## Withdrawal Eligibility

Withdrawal eligibility depends on the selected Earn product:

**Flexible Earn**
- Withdrawals may be initiated at any time
- There are no notice requirements or penalties

**Fixed Earn**
- Withdrawals are available at maturity
- Early withdrawals follow predefined exit mechanisms
- No other withdrawal methods are permitted

Withdrawal eligibility is enforced automatically.

## Withdrawal Execution Rules

All withdrawals on Growmax follow strict execution controls:

- Withdrawals can only be sent to the original wallet used for deposit
- Withdrawal destinations cannot be changed
- Withdrawal requests require wallet confirmation
- Execution follows platform processing rules

These rules are applied uniformly to all users.

## Withdrawal Fees

- No withdrawal fees apply to Earn products
- Network (gas) fees, if applicable, are paid by the user
- Growmax does not impose hidden or discretionary withdrawal charges on Earn products

## Timing & Processing

Withdrawal processing may involve:

- On-chain confirmation times
- Internal execution sequencing
- Network congestion considerations

Growmax does not guarantee instant settlement in all conditions, but processes withdrawals according to documented rules.

## Completion & Release of Custody

Upon successful withdrawal:

- Principal and accrued rewards are released
- Custody ends
- The product lifecycle is complete
- Assets are returned directly to the originating wallet

## Important Considerations

Users should be aware that:

- Reward accrual stops once assets are withdrawn
- Withdrawal requests cannot be reversed once initiated
- Withdrawals sent to incorrect networks may be unrecoverable

Growmax encourages users to verify details before confirming withdrawals.

## Summary

The Growmax rewards and withdrawal system is designed to provide:

- Clear daily reward visibility
- Fixed and predictable earning behaviour
- Secure, wallet-bound withdrawals
- Explicit execution rules

This structure ensures users understand how rewards are earned, when they are available, and how assets are returned.
