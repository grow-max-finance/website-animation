# Collateral, LTV & Liquidation

This section explains the core risk concepts that govern how borrowing works on Growmax: Collateral, Loan-to-Value (LTV), and Liquidation.

Understanding these concepts is essential before using any borrowing product. Borrowing on Growmax is rule-based, automated, and non-discretionary, meaning outcomes are determined strictly by these parameters.

## Collateral

Collateral is a digital asset that a user deposits to secure a loan.

On Growmax, collateral serves one purpose only: **To protect the borrowed amount against market volatility.**

When a user deposits collateral:

- The asset is locked under controlled custody
- It cannot be used, transferred, or withdrawn while the loan is active
- Legal ownership remains with the user

Collateral is not a fee and not spent. It is held as security and released when the loan is repaid according to product terms.

### Why Collateral is Required

Digital asset prices can change rapidly. Collateral ensures that:

- Loans remain covered even if asset prices fall
- The platform does not rely on creditworthiness or discretion
- Borrowing risk is managed transparently and automatically

Growmax requires over-collateralisation, meaning users must deposit collateral worth more than the borrowed amount.

This is a deliberate design choice to reduce systemic risk.

## Loan-to-Value (LTV)

Loan-to-Value (LTV) is a ratio that measures loan risk.

It represents how much has been borrowed relative to the value of the collateral.

### LTV Formula

```
LTV = Borrowed Amount ÷ Current Collateral Value
```

**Example:**
- Collateral value: $10,000
- Borrowed amount: $5,000
- LTV = 50%

As collateral prices change, the LTV changes automatically.

### Why LTV Matters

LTV is the primary risk indicator for borrow positions.

- Lower LTV = safer position
- Higher LTV = higher risk of liquidation

Growmax continuously monitors LTV to ensure loans remain adequately secured.

Borrowing capacity, margin calls, and liquidation events are all determined by LTV thresholds.

## Margin Calls (Risk Warning Stage)

A margin call occurs when LTV reaches a predefined risk warning level.

At this stage:

- The loan is still active
- Collateral has declined relative to the loan
- The user is expected to act

Typical actions include:

- Adding more collateral
- Repaying part of the loan

Margin calls are alerts, not enforcement actions.

Market movement continues regardless of notifications.

## Liquidation

Liquidation is the automatic enforcement mechanism that protects the platform and users from under-collateralised loans.

If LTV reaches the liquidation threshold:

- The system automatically liquidates collateral
- Collateral is sold to settle the outstanding loan
- Execution follows predefined rules

Liquidation is not discretionary and cannot be manually delayed or overridden.

### Why Liquidation Exists

Liquidation ensures that:

- Borrowed funds remain protected
- Losses do not exceed collateral value
- Risk is managed consistently across all users

Without liquidation, borrowing platforms become vulnerable to insolvency during sharp market movements.

Growmax enforces liquidation early and conservatively to avoid cascading risk.

### Post-Liquidation Outcomes

After liquidation:

- The borrowed amount is settled
- Execution costs and market slippage may apply
- Any remaining collateral (if available) is returned

Liquidation outcomes depend on market conditions at the time of execution.

Users may experience partial or total collateral loss.

## No Discretion or Exceptions

Growmax does not:

- Pause liquidation due to market sentiment
- Make exceptions for individual users
- Manually intervene in borrow positions

All outcomes are determined strictly by rules defined in advance.

This removes uncertainty and ensures equal treatment.

## User Responsibility

Borrowing on Growmax requires active monitoring.

Users are responsible for:

- Understanding LTV mechanics
- Monitoring collateral health
- Managing exposure during volatile markets

Growmax provides structure and enforcement, not judgment.

## Summary

Collateral, LTV, and liquidation form the core safety framework of Growmax Borrow.

- **Collateral** secures the loan
- **LTV** measures risk in real time
- **Liquidation** enforces protection automatically

This framework ensures that borrowing remains transparent, predictable, and disciplined, even during extreme market conditions.
