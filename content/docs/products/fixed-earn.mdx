# Fixed Earn (18%)

Fixed Earn is designed for users who are comfortable committing capital for a defined period in exchange for a higher, predictable return.

This product offers a fixed annual return with a clearly defined tenure and pre-agreed exit options. All rules governing participation, rewards, and exits are disclosed upfront and enforced consistently.

## Product Objective

The objective of Fixed Earn is to provide:

- Higher fixed returns compared to flexible products
- Clear tenure-based capital commitment
- Transparent early exit options
- Predictable outcomes for long-term planners

Fixed Earn is intentionally structured for users who value certainty and are willing to accept defined constraints in exchange for enhanced returns.

## Supported Asset

**Asset: USDT**

Fixed Earn supports USDT only, ensuring:

- Stable accounting
- Predictable reward accrual
- Reduced exposure to market volatility

## Return & Tenure Structure

- **Return Rate:** 18% per annum
- **Tenure:** 12 months
- **Reward Accrual:** Daily

The return rate is fixed at the time of participation and does not change during the tenure.

Rewards accrue daily throughout the product lifecycle and are tracked transparently in the platform interface.

## Participation Mechanics

Participation in Fixed Earn is fully user-initiated:

1. The user connects a supported wallet
2. The user deposits USDT into the Fixed Earn product
3. The 12-month tenure begins upon confirmation
4. Rewards begin accruing from the next accrual cycle

All deposits require explicit wallet approval.

## Custody During Participation

- Assets are held under controlled custody for the duration of the tenure
- Custody exists solely to enable Fixed Earn execution
- Legal ownership of assets remains with the user
- Assets are not used outside the scope of the Fixed Earn product

## Rewards Accrual & Visibility

Rewards under Fixed Earn:

- Accrue daily
- Are calculated based on the deposited principal
- Are visible daily through the platform interface

Rewards are not compounded unless explicitly stated.

## Product Maturity

At the end of the 12-month tenure:

- The Fixed Earn product reaches maturity
- Users become eligible to withdraw principal and accrued rewards
- Withdrawals follow standard platform execution and security rules
- No withdrawal fees apply to Fixed Earn at maturity
- Assets are released from custody upon successful withdrawal

## Early Exit Options

Fixed Earn provides two predefined early exit mechanisms. No other exit methods are available.

### 1. 90-Day Notice Exit

- User submits an early exit request
- Assets remain locked for a 90-day notice period
- No capital deduction is applied
- Rewards continue to accrue during the notice period

This option is designed for users who can plan exits in advance.

### 2. Instant Exit

- User exits immediately without notice
- A 6% capital deduction is applied to the principal
- Accrued rewards are settled according to product rules

This option prioritises speed over capital preservation.

## Withdrawal Rules

All withdrawals from Fixed Earn:

- Can only be sent to the original deposit wallet
- Cannot be redirected or modified
- Are executed according to platform processing rules
- Do not incur withdrawal fees

These controls are enforced automatically.

## Use Cases

Fixed Earn is suitable for users who:

- Are comfortable with a defined 12-month commitment
- Prefer higher fixed returns over liquidity
- Plan capital allocation in advance
- Value transparency and predefined exits

## Important Notes

- Tenure and exit rules cannot be modified after participation
- Early exit options are fixed and non-discretionary
- Product rules apply uniformly to all users
- Users should ensure suitability before committing capital
