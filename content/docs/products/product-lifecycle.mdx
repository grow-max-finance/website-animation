# Product Lifecycle (Tenure & Early Exit)

This section explains how Growmax Earn products behave from entry to exit, including tenure handling, maturity, and early exit mechanics.

Every Growmax product follows a defined lifecycle. There are no open-ended commitments, discretionary extensions, or ad-hoc changes once a user participates.

## Lifecycle Principles

All Growmax Earn products are governed by the following principles:

- Product terms are fixed at the time of participation
- Lifecycle stages are predefined and documented
- Exit conditions are explicit and enforceable
- No manual overrides or discretionary exceptions apply

This structure ensures consistent behaviour across all users and market conditions.

## Lifecycle Stages

Each Earn product progresses through the following stages:

1. Participation (Entry)
2. Active Accrual Period
3. Maturity or Exit Trigger
4. Withdrawal & Release of Custody

### 1. Participation (Entry)

Participation begins when:

- A user connects a supported wallet
- The user deposits USDT into an Earn product
- The transaction is confirmed on-chain

Once participation is confirmed:

- Product terms are locked
- The selected Earn product becomes active
- Rewards begin accruing from the next accrual cycle

### 2. Active Accrual Period

During the active period:

- Rewards accrue daily
- Accrual is based on the deposited principal
- Rewards are visible through the platform interface
- Assets remain under controlled custody

The behaviour during this stage differs slightly between Flexible and Fixed Earn.

**Flexible Earn**
- No predefined end date
- Accrual continues until the user withdraws

**Fixed Earn**
- Accrual continues for a fixed 12-month tenure
- Tenure countdown begins at participation

### 3. Maturity & Exit Triggers

**Flexible Earn**

Flexible Earn does not have a maturity date.

- The product remains active until the user initiates a withdrawal
- There are no penalties or notice requirements
- Rewards stop accruing once assets are withdrawn

**Fixed Earn (Maturity)**

Fixed Earn reaches maturity at the end of the 12-month tenure.

At maturity:

- The product completes automatically
- The user becomes eligible to withdraw principal and accrued rewards
- Assets are released from custody upon withdrawal

There are no rollover or auto-renewal mechanisms unless explicitly introduced in the future.

### 4. Early Exit (Fixed Earn Only)

Fixed Earn offers two predefined early exit options. No other exit mechanisms are available.

#### 4.1 90-Day Notice Exit

- User submits a notice to exit
- Assets remain locked for a 90-day notice period
- Rewards continue to accrue during the notice period
- No capital deduction is applied

This option prioritises capital preservation with planned liquidity.

#### 4.2 Instant Exit

- User exits immediately
- A 6% capital deduction is applied to the principal
- Rewards accrued up to exit are settled according to product rules

This option prioritises immediate liquidity over capital efficiency.

### 5. Withdrawal & Release of Custody

Once an exit or maturity condition is met:

- The user may initiate withdrawal
- Assets can only be withdrawn to the original deposit wallet
- Withdrawal destinations cannot be changed
- No withdrawal fees apply to Earn products

Upon successful withdrawal:

- Custody ends
- The product lifecycle is complete

## No Discretionary Changes

Growmax does not:

- Extend tenures without user consent
- Modify exit penalties retroactively
- Freeze withdrawals outside documented rules
- Override lifecycle logic manually

All lifecycle behaviour is rule-based and consistent.

## User Responsibility

Users are responsible for:

- Selecting products aligned with their liquidity needs
- Understanding tenure and exit implications before participation
- Monitoring product status through the platform

Growmax encourages users to review product documentation before committing capital.

## Summary

The Growmax Earn lifecycle is designed to provide:

- Clear entry points
- Predictable accrual
- Explicit exits
- Enforced release conditions

This structured lifecycle ensures users always know where they are in the product journey and what options are available.
