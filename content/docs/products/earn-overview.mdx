# Earn (Overview)

Growmax Earn is designed to provide users with predictable, fixed-rate returns on supported digital assets through structured participation models with clearly defined rules, timelines, and exit conditions.

Earn products on Growmax prioritise capital discipline, transparency, and simplicity. They are not performance-based, algorithmic, or variable-yield products. Returns, tenure, and exit mechanics are disclosed upfront and enforced strictly according to documented terms.

Growmax Earn is built for users who value clarity, consistency, and long-term reliability over yield optimisation or speculative exposure.

## Purpose of Earn Products

The primary objective of Growmax Earn is to allow users to:

- Generate consistent returns on idle digital assets
- Choose between liquidity-focused or tenure-based earning options
- Understand outcomes before committing capital
- Exit participation under predefined and transparent conditions

Earn products are structured to behave consistently across market conditions rather than dynamically adjusting to volatility.

## Fixed-Rate Structure

All Growmax Earn products operate on a fixed-rate basis.

This means:

- Returns are defined at the time of participation
- Rates do not fluctuate based on market conditions
- Rewards accrue and are accounted for daily
- There are no variable APYs or performance-linked adjustments

This structure allows users to assess suitability based on known inputs and known outcomes.

## Asset Scope

Growmax Earn currently supports **USDT only**.

This limitation is intentional and reflects the platform's focus on:

- Minimising price volatility exposure
- Maintaining accounting clarity
- Ensuring predictable reward calculations

By restricting Earn participation to a single stable asset, Growmax avoids unnecessary complexity and risk layering.

## Participation & Custody

Participation in Growmax Earn is entirely user-initiated.

- Users deposit assets from their connected wallet
- Assets are held under controlled custody for the duration of participation
- Custody exists solely to enable Earn product execution
- Legal ownership of assets remains with the user
- Custody ends when assets are withdrawn or when the product tenure completes

## Rewards Accrual & Visibility

Earn rewards accrue daily.

Key characteristics:

- Rewards are calculated based on active participation
- Accrued rewards are visible daily through the platform interface
- Rewards are not compounded unless explicitly stated

This daily accounting ensures continuous transparency for users.

## Liquidity & Exit Design

Growmax Earn products offer explicit and predefined exit mechanisms.

- **Flexible Earn** prioritises liquidity and ease of access
- **Fixed Earn** prioritises higher returns with a defined tenure
- Early exit options (where applicable) are documented in advance
- There are no discretionary lock-ups or undefined withdrawal restrictions

Users always know the conditions under which capital can be accessed.

## Withdrawals

Withdrawals from Growmax Earn products follow strict security and execution rules:

- Withdrawals can only be made to the original wallet used for deposit
- Withdrawal destinations cannot be changed
- No withdrawal fees apply to Earn products

These rules are enforced automatically and are not subject to manual overrides.

## Risk Considerations

While Growmax Earn focuses on predictability, participation still involves risk.

Users should consider:

- Platform and operational risk
- Custody-related risk during participation
- Regulatory and jurisdictional considerations

**Growmax does not guarantee capital protection or returns.**

## Positioning of Earn Products

Growmax Earn is positioned as a structured earning solution, not a speculative investment product.

The design philosophy emphasises:

- Simplicity over complexity
- Rules over discretion
- Predictable behaviour over optimisation

Users are encouraged to review individual Earn product pages for specific terms before participating.
