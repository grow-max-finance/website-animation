# How Growmax Works

Growmax operates using a **wallet-connect–only architecture**.

The platform does not create or manage user accounts. There are:

- No usernames or passwords
- No email-based authentication
- No internal user wallets

Users connect an external wallet and approve all actions directly from that wallet.

## Core Operating Mechanics

- **Participation is user-initiated** - All actions require explicit user approval
- **Transactions require explicit wallet approval** - No automated transactions
- **Assets are custodied only for the duration of active product participation** - Temporary custody model
- **Withdrawals are restricted to the original deposit wallet** - Enhanced security
- **Product rules are enforced automatically and uniformly** - No discretionary changes

This architecture ensures that authorisation, custody, and withdrawal rights remain cryptographically tied to the user, reducing reliance on human intervention and discretionary controls.
