# What is Growmax

Growmax is a wallet-connected digital asset platform that enables users to:

- Earn fixed returns on supported digital assets
- Access liquidity through over-collateralised borrowing
- Participate in a transparent, rules-based referral program

All Growmax products operate under clearly documented terms. There are no variable algorithms, discretionary interventions, or opaque yield mechanisms.

## Platform Design

Growmax is designed to be:

- **Easy to understand** - Clear documentation and transparent rules
- **Predictable in behaviour** - Fixed parameters and consistent execution
- **Explicit about risk** - Upfront disclosure of fees and exit conditions

Users interact with Growmax through their own wallets, maintaining control over transaction authorisation while relying on the platform for structured execution.
