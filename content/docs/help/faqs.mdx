- **Flexible Earn (12%):** No lock-up period, withdraw anytime, 12% annual return

### Which assets can I use for Earn products?

## Borrow Products

### What assets can I use as collateral?

Growmax Borrow accepts the following BEP-20 assets as collateral:
- BTC (BEP-20)
- ETH (BEP-20)
- SOL (BEP-20)
- BNB (native / BEP-20)

### What is LTV?

LTV (Loan-to-Value) is the ratio of your borrowed amount to your collateral value. It measures the risk level of your borrow position.

### What happens if my collateral value drops?

If your LTV reaches the margin call threshold, you'll receive a warning. If it reaches the liquidation threshold, your collateral will be automatically liquidated to repay the loan.

### Can I add more collateral to my position?

Yes, you can add more collateral at any time to improve your LTV and reduce liquidation risk.

## Referral Program

### How does the Referral Program work?

You earn 10% of the Earn rewards generated by users you refer, for as long as they remain active.

### Do I need to be active to earn referral rewards?

Yes. You must maintain an active Earn product allocation to earn referral rewards.

### Can I refer myself?

Yes. Self-referrals are permitted and treated the same as standard referrals.

### Do referral rewards reduce my referred user's earnings?

No. Referral rewards are paid separately and do not affect the referred user's earnings.

## Security & Safety

### How are my assets secured?

Assets are held under controlled custody during product participation. Withdrawals can only be sent to your original deposit wallet, preventing unauthorized redirections.

### Can I change my withdrawal address?

No. For security reasons, withdrawals can only be sent to the wallet address used for the original deposit.

### What if I send assets to the wrong network?

Assets sent to unsupported networks or using incorrect token standards cannot be recovered. Always verify you're using BNB Chain and BEP-20 tokens.

### Does Growmax have insurance?

No. Growmax does not provide deposit insurance or capital guarantees. All participation involves risk.

## Technical Questions

### Why is my transaction pending?

Transactions may be pending due to network congestion or insufficient gas fees. Check your wallet and the BNB Chain block explorer for status.
